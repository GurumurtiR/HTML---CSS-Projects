                <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, 
                   and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted 
                   the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Liberty 
                   Island and commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t 
                   unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for 
                   the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The 
                   New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. s
                   New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.
